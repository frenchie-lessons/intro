# INTRO

Hi Mike! these instructions will get you set up.

## Preface
On the way, I'm going to teach you how to use Github.

If you get confused or have any issues with what to do here, do not text me first.

First, use Github to file an issue [here](https://github.com/frenchie-lessons/intro/issues) with the "New Issue" button.
Create an issue describing what problem you are having. Then text me, becuase I don't check my email :).

## Mandatory

### VS Code
VS Code is your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  It is where you write and run code.

Download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx), and move it to your Applications folder.

### Node and NPM
Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript.

In english, that means it enables your computer to run the programs you're going to write.

Follow the instructions [here](https://tecadmin.net/install-nvm-macos-with-homebrew/) and you should be all set.

## Optional

### iTerm and zsh
When you're not in VSCode, you will primarily use your computer through a Shell (also colloquially known as a Terminal).

MacOS comes with a terminal. It's called Terminal. lol.

I use iTerm2. It's very customizable, which can be useful.
Inside of iTerm2, I use the `zsh` shell. Along with `zsh`, I use "oh-my-zsh", which allows you to customize `zsh` even further.

The above information doesn't matter a whole lot. Ignore it if it doesn't make sense, I'm sure it doesn't. haha.

- Install iTerm2 from [here](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html).
- Install `zsh` by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH).
- Install `oh-my-zsh` by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#basic-installation)

I'll show you how to get some cool themes later. If you get to the point where you can get iTerm2 open with `zsh` running,
you are doing at least 69,000 times better than I did on my first day of programming. Cheers!

#### Details about Terminals and Shells
Don't read this unless you're curious, it really doesn't matter right now.

Technically on stock MacOS, you interact with the `bash` terminal through the `Terminal` terminal/console application.
You could use the `zsh` shell in Terminal. You can use the `bash` shell in `iTerm`. 

Using `iTerm` with `zsh` with the zsh agnoster theme is just my preference. Feel free to play around.

There *technically* is a difference between shells, and console/terminals, and even the difference between consoles and terminals.
But it really doesn't matter right now. Wikipedia is there if you want to learn the difference, but don't sweat it.

I was in the industry with a few promotions under my belt before I even figured out what the difference was, hahaha.
